This project addresses the problem of inconsistent quality in 3D printing, leading to 
wasted prints and resources. Current methods lack effective real-time monitoring, 
making it hard to optimize printing and prevent defects. The need for this solution arises 
from the desire to reduce waste, improve print success rates, and enhance overall 
efficiency in 3D printing. Existing approaches like manual inspection and visual cameras 
have limitations, focusing on specific defects and lacking comprehensive monitoring. Our 
solution is an easy-to-use IoT-based system using sensors, cameras, and AI algorithms. It 
analyzes data in real-time, identifies issues during printing, and uses machine learning to 
predict and prevent failures. The dataset includes sensor readings, printed object data, 
and material properties. The goal is to make 3D printing more reliable and efficient, 
especially for large-scaleÂ production.
